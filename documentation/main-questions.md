# Main questions

## What are the main purposes or features of this app ?

- I need the hability of upload the medical information. Like text and images (try to have this updated).
- I need the hability of upload medical information of my patients. And only be able to see the information which was uploaded by me or the information that my patient share to me.

## The app should only be created to store personal information of the users?

Not really, it can be a platform to also store medical information of medical consultants of his patients.

## Who can see the information?

The medical information it's mine and anyone should see that without my permission. But if I give permission to one person how much information should see that person?

## I'm the only person who is capable of upload information into the platform?

At first this is the main purpose. I have to be capable of upload my information.
But a secondary feature should give the hability to a medic of upload information to my profile. An after that the user have to be able of see the information uploaded by the doctor.

## Which path we should prioritize? enable a user to store his information or enable to an organization to upload the information of his patients?

For now I think the best approach it could be to enable organizations to upload his information. To fill the database of the platform. And also to be able of sell the product.

## Which options could need an organization?

- Be able to create patient registers (Main)
  - Upload the patient's information (Main)
- Be able to create notes or add medical information from the appointments with the patients:
  - be able to create notes which are private of the organization and the patients shouldn't be able to see that (for example of a psicologist)
  - be able to create notes which are public and the patients should be able to see that (for example of a general doctor or a medication) 
- See the list of my patients (Main)
- See the appointments with my patients (Main):
  - be able to see the appointments of the day and week (Secondary?)
  - be able to see all the appointments of the patients. f.e. in the patient profile I can see the appointments that I had with her. (Main) 
- Search for patients with his identifiers or his names (Main)
- Be able to schedule dates with my patients (Secondary?)
